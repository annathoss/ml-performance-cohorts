  abstract  = "Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of machine learning (ML)
               has been increasingly employed in the research of trauma in
               various aspects. Hemorrhage is the most common cause of
               trauma-related death. To better elucidate the current role of AI
               and contribute to future development of ML in trauma care, we
               conducted a review focused on the use of ML in the diagnosis or
               treatment strategy of traumatic hemorrhage. A literature search
               was carried out on PubMed and Google scholar. Titles and
               abstracts were screened and, if deemed appropriate, the full
               articles were reviewed. We included 89 studies in the review.
               These studies could be grouped into five areas: (1) prediction
               of outcomes; (2) risk assessment and injury severity for triage;
               (3) prediction of transfusions; (4) detection of hemorrhage; and
               (5) prediction of coagulopathy. Performance analysis of ML in
               comparison with current standards for trauma care showed that
               most studies demonstrated the benefits of ML models. However,
               most studies were retrospective, focused on prediction of
               mortality, and development of patient outcome scoring systems.
               Few studies performed model assessment via test datasets
               obtained from different sources. Prediction models for
               transfusions and coagulopathy have been developed, but none is
               in widespread use. AI-enabled ML-driven technology is becoming
               integral part of the whole course of trauma care. Comparison and
               application of ML algorithms using different datasets from
               initial training, testing and validation in prospective and
               randomized controlled trials are warranted for provision of
               decision support for individualized patient care as far forward

  abstract  = "Emergency Radiology is a unique branch of imaging, as rapidity
               in the diagnosis and management of different pathologies is
               essential to saving patients' lives. Artificial Intelligence
               (AI) has many potential applications in emergency radiology:
               firstly, image acquisition can be facilitated by reducing
               acquisition times through automatic positioning and minimizing
               artifacts with AI-based reconstruction systems to optimize image
               quality, even in critical patients; secondly, it enables an
               efficient workflow (AI algorithms integrated with RIS-PACS
               workflow), by analyzing the characteristics and images of
               patients, detecting high-priority examinations and patients with
               emergent critical findings. Different machine and deep learning
               algorithms have been trained for the automated detection of
               different types of emergency disorders (e.g., intracranial
               hemorrhage, bone fractures, pneumonia), to help radiologists to
               detect relevant findings. AI-based smart reporting, summarizing
               patients' clinical data, and analyzing the grading of the
               imaging abnormalities, can provide an objective indicator of the
               disease's severity, resulting in quick and optimized treatment
               planning. In this review, we provide an overview of the
               different AI tools available in emergency radiology, to keep
               radiologists up to date on the current technological evolution

  author    = "Chen, Jiayang and See, Kay Choong",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and
               has since evolved into a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To address this
               global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has been
               deployed at various levels of the health care system. However,
               AI has both potential benefits and limitations. We therefore
               conducted a review of AI applications for COVID-19. METHODS: We
               performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases
               for COVID-19-related English-language studies published between
               December 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. We supplemented the
               database search with reference list checks. A thematic analysis
               and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was
               conducted. RESULTS: In total, 11 papers were included for
               review. AI was applied to COVID-19 in four areas: diagnosis,
               public health, clinical decision making, and therapeutics. We
               identified several limitations including insufficient data,
               omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in
               realization of benefits, poor internal/external validation,
               inability to be used by laypersons, inability to be used in
               resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and
               presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in
               four other areas: surveillance, combination with big data,
               operation of other core clinical services, and management of
               patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the continuing
               increase in the number of cases, and given that multiple waves
               of infections may occur, there is a need for effective methods
               to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its shortcomings,
               AI holds the potential to greatly augment existing human
               efforts, which may otherwise be overwhelmed by high patient
               numbers.",
